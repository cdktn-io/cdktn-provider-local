## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform local provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 2.1` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by [generating the provider constructs manually](https://cdktn.io/docs/concepts/providers#import-providers).

These are the upstream dependencies:

- [CDK Terrain](https://cdktn.io) - Last official release
- [Terraform local provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/2.7.0)
- [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.
